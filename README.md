# Themes

Themes with `dark`、`light`、and `devices` that made with `javascript` and `react`.

## Css

Using css you can only detect devices's appearance and inplements them

## JavaScript

In my final version of this project, I simply leanrnd from [`Tailwindcss` documentation][def]

## React

Remember that you have to use `state` to be able to trigger rerendering of the theme's changes.
